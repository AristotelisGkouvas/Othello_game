# Othello_game
Othello, also known as Reversi, is a two-player board game that involves strategic thinking and planning. 
The objective of the game is to have more pieces of your color on the board than your opponent by the end of the game. 
The game is played on an 8x8 board, and each player starts with two pieces of their color in the center of the board. 
Players take turns placing pieces on the board and flipping their opponent's pieces to their own color. 
The game ends when the board is full or when neither player can make a move.
